/// The `AWSDateTime` scalar type provided by AWS AppSync, represents a valid ***extended*** [ISO 8601 DateTime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations) string. In other words, this scalar type accepts datetime strings of the form `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.SSSZ`.  The scalar can also accept "negative years" of the form `-YYYY` which correspond to years before `0000`. For example, "**-2017-01-01T00:00Z**" and "**-9999-01-01T00:00Z**" are both valid datetime strings.  The field after the two digit seconds field is a nanoseconds field. It can accept between 1 and 9 digits. So, for example, "**1970-01-01T12:00:00.2Z**", "**1970-01-01T12:00:00.277Z**" and "**1970-01-01T12:00:00.123456789Z**" are all valid datetime strings.  The seconds and nanoseconds fields are optional (the seconds field must be specified if the nanoseconds field is to be used).  The [time zone offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_zone_designators) is compulsory for this scalar. The time zone offset must either be `Z` (representing the UTC time zone) or be in the format `Â±hh:mm:ss`. The seconds field in the timezone offset will be considered valid even though it is not part of the ISO 8601 standard.
